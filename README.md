# Advent of Go-de

I'm learning Go by advent of code

Just one `go.mod` file

reusable `packages`

`go test` by default doesn't print log statements to output.

`go test -v` will show those

`go test ./<dir-name>` to specify sub-directory

`go test -run=<regex>` to filter tests by name

I've added an alias `gotest` aka `gt` to print go test output with colours

`gt ./... -v` to see everything!
